Suppose software wants to check for the following FORMAT.
99999-AAAAAAA-9

Where; 
9 is any number from 0 to 9
A is any letter from A to Z

-----CODE (with Rules Mentioned.)---------
Input NIC

1. Check for Length
--------------------
If Len(NIC) <> 15 Then
   output "Not Valid"
   Exit
Endif

2. Identify fixed positions and check for them
----------------------------------------------- 
If MID(NIC,6,1) <> "-" OR _
   MID(NIC,14,1) <> "-" Then

   output "Not Valid"
   Exit
Endif

3. Identify Groups and check for them.
--------------------------------------
For Count = 1 to 5
	Char=MID(NIC,Count,1)
        If Char >= "0" AND Char <= "9"
	Else
     	   output "Not Valid"
           Exit
        Endif
Next Count

For Count = 7 to 13
	Char=MID(NIC,Count,1)
        If (Char >= "A" AND Char <= "Z") or (Char >= "a" AND Char <= "z")
	Else
     	   output "Not Valid"
           Exit
        Endif
Next Count

For Count = 15 to 15
	Char=MID(NIC,Count,1)
        If Char >= "0" AND Char <= "9"
	Else
     	   output "Not Valid"
           Exit
        Endif
Next Count
